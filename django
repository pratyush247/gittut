1.using django generic relations
a)knowing about contenttype framework
b)COntentType is object that stores all model name
c)
import
	.from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType

 	 Next you must create a dictionary so that the content types framework can know which models to limit your generic foreign key to:
	.profile_or_event = {'app_label__in': ('myapp',), 'model__in': ('profile', 'event', ), }

	Finally you must add 3 fields into the model in which you wish to have the generic foreign key:
	.content_type = models.ForeignKey(ContentType, limit_choices_to=profile_or_event)
	.object_id = models.PositiveIntegerField()
	.profie_event = generic.GenericForeignKey()
